									<h4> CATERING UNEMPLOYMENT
Many companies or employees will be able to go back to their work after this Unlock is properly completed. Now, these companies have been reliant on the government protection scheme, but for how long, at some point subsidies wither out, then the companies have to lay off their employees in one way or another. This will actually accelerate the unemployment rate at different levels. Our website Urban Hope provides people suffering from this pandemic job opportunities and are trying to teach people with various techniques and methods that are useful in this type of INDIAN market . With thorough research team we try to find the best out of the people wo apply with us and try to find out the strengths and weaknesses of different people.
PROVIDING HEALTHCARE IN COVID 19
The diversity of India is reflected in the Covid journey of states, which are at different levels of infection, response and recovery. Ten states currently account for 90% of India’s infections. Behind the scenes, however, India’s federal structure is at play with centralized policy decision and action guiding decentralized and contextualized response in the states.
