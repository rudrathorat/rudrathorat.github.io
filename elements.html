							<h3>Our Key Highlights of the Past and present at URBAN HOPE</h3>
						</header>

						
							
							<h5>We are a organisation who believe in firmly adapting to today's lifestyle changes and helping people to deal with various stages. From unempoyment due to COVID 19 pandemic or education to the student and providing healthcare to the people. We at Urban Hope are the set of people committed to work extensively.</h5><div class="row">
								<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
									<h3>LOCAL MEDIA</h3>
									<h5>We can support local media by collaborating and sharing ideas, experiences and seek opportunities to provide training, equipment or even forming local networks of journalists who usually report on issues that the NGO deals with. Go beyond just sending press releases or holding press conferences and try to attend events that involve local reporters and also visit the newsrooms to familiarise yourself with how these local reporters work. Invite them to your offices and engage with them beyond the facts/figures that you send. </h5></div>
								<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
									<h3>Our Bonds</h3>
									<h5>Last year we were part of a group of NGOs and activists that engaged in very critical and honest self reflection, and a key theme that emerged was that we needed to leave our brands behind a little more. Connect with other NGOs. Ultimately, we’re all in it together.</h5>
</div>
								
								<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
									<h3>CATERING UNEMPLOYMENT</h3>
									<h5>Many companies or employees will be able to go back to their work after this Unlock is properly completed. Now, these companies have been reliant on the government protection scheme, but for how long, at some point subsidies wither out, then the companies have to lay off their employees in one way or another. This will actually accelerate the unemployment rate at different levels. 
Our website Urban Hope provides people suffering from this pandemic job opportunities and are trying to teach people with various techniques and methods that are useful in this type of INDIAN market . With thorough research team we try to find the best out of the people wo apply with us and try to find out the strengths and weaknesses of different people.
</h5></div>
								<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
									<h3>PROVIDING HEALTHCARE IN COVID 19</h3>
									<h5>The diversity of India is reflected in the Covid journey of states, which are at different levels of infection, response and recovery. Ten states currently account for 90% of India’s infections. Behind the scenes, however, India’s federal structure is at play with centralized policy decision and action guiding decentralized and contextualized response in the states.</h5></div>
								<div class="4u$ 12u$(medium)">
									<h3>EDUCATION FOR EVERYONE</h3>
									<h5>Education is the most important thing in a students career and after the COVID-19 virus the education system has been affected . But people are trying to find its alternatives by going online and looking for courses that are important for their careers . 
Our website Urban hope provides information information about the various courses that are beneficial and are important to learn in this present market and we show the students where to access these courses for free
